# Documentation
This directory contains source files for documentation.  
The documentation is written using [Typst](https://typst.app/).

In order to compile and read the PDF file, run `make` here.

To remove the file, run `make clean`.

## Archive
The archive should contain only the final PDF, not the sources and/or Makefile.

For the full Typst source, please check the GitHub repository.
