## Purpose
This repository serves to contain the Python source code and testing files for this project, as well as the full documentation Typst sources.

For additional information, please check the relevant folders.

## Usage
The included Makefile can be used for the following actions:
* `make check` — run the built-in tests
* `make docs`  — build the documentation PDF (repo only, the file is included directly in the archive)
* `make pack`  — generate the ZIP archive of the repo, for whatever reason
* `make clean` — remove created files (note that this will fail in the archive version, since the documentation Makefile is not provided).
